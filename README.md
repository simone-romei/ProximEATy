# ProximEATy

Introducing ProximEATy. An interactive map-based solution that helps users locate and purchase food products based on availability and proximity.

COVID-19 has pushed the European Food Industry to a tipping point. Farmer’s Markets across the European Union are in limbo, wholesale orders from restaurants are at a standstill, and farmer’s simply can’t keep up with the demands of digitalizing their business. So, we asked ourselves how might we mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on pan-European food security?

ProximEATy was created to open a new direct sales channel connecting local producers with local consumers to shorten the food supply chain and ensure sustainable food security/support the resilience of local food economies.

Our solution creates economic opportunities for local food producers and increases consumer access to local food.
